It started out as a fun joke about how one cannot read through the tone and context of the other person. I longed for a tool which could do so.Living in the AI age I taught why not make this into a fun project.I could be learning how to build chrome browswer extensions.
I have made two prototypes of this.
This is the second one which I liked far simpler sober and  easy to use.

There are plenty of use cases  one can find from this.I am just a beginner to all of this.
I have used the Google Gemini Api key.
